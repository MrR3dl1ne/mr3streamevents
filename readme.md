# Mr3StreamEvents

## Description

This libary contains a range of functionality to help streamers of all types. The tools within are able to capture events from some of the major stream providers (twitch, youtube, etc..) and perform actions.

At the time of writing this, the only actions supported are sending a request to a remote REST endpoint (like Home Assistant) or playing a variety of sounds. More actions will be coming shortly as we build on this base. Using the REST integration would allow a streamer to execution automations in their Home Assistant or other automation software when events occur, like follows, subs and comments.
